## Get Started
### Prerequisites

To run this package, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.
- **Docker**: To streamline the environment setup and execution.
- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** (if using an NVIDIA GPU): For hardware acceleration.


### Installation

#### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CDonosoK/astroviz.git
```

#### Build Using Docker
This repository includes a pre-configured Docker setup for easy deployment. To build the Docker image:
1. Navigate to the `docker` directory:
   ```bash
   cd astroviz/docker
   ```
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   sh build.sh

## Usage
### Node Overview

This package nodes that are designed to facilitate teleoperation and visualization of data. Each node serves a specific purpose in the teleoperation workflow:
- **gpsmap_viewer**: Visualizes GPS data on a map.
- **camera_viewer**: Displays camera feed from the robot.
- **imu_viewer**: Visualizes IMU data.
- **lidar_viewer**: Visualizes LiDAR data.
- **teleoperation_viewer**: Provides a GUI for teleoperation control.
- **dashboard_viewer**: A comprehensive dashboard that integrates various data streams and provides a unified interface for monitoring and control.
- **plot_viewer**: Displays real-time plots of various data streams.
- **grid_map_viewer**: Visualizes grid map data for navigation and planning.
- **robot_state_viewer**: Displays the current state of the robot related to the joint positions and transformations.
- **motor_state_viewer**: Monitors and visualizes the state of the robot's motors, including temperature and voltage readings.


### Running Nodes
To run the nodes, you can use the following command:
```bash
ros2 run astroviz <node_name>
```
Replace `<node_name>` with the name of the node you wish to run, such as `gps_map_viewer`, `camera_viewer`, etc.

Or if you prefer to run the dashboard viewer, which integrates all functionalities:
```bash
ros2 run astroviz dashboard_viewer
```
